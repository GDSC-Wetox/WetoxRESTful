## ‚å®Ô∏è How to run
1. Clone the WetoxRESTful repository to the appropriate location and enter the directory.
   ```bash
   # if you are using HTTPS to clone
   git clone https://github.com/GDSC-Wetox/WetoxRESTful.git

   # or...
   
   # if you are using SSH to clone
   git clone git@github.com:GDSC-Wetox/WetoxRESTful.git
   ```
   ```bash
   cd WetoxRESTful
   ```
2. Make sure you are at the branch named `release`
   ```bash
   git switch release
   ```
3. Build projects using gradle.
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build
   ```
5. The request to the API server is forwarded to 8080 ports, and the request for AI-generated images is forwarded to 5000 ports. The following is an example of a NGINX setup.
   ```
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name api.wetox.dev;
    
       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
       }
    
       location /ai {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
       }
   }
   ```
7. Check the environment variables, database settings, and security settings.]
   ```
   export GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=<Google project ID here>
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<Google Application crendential file path here>
   export FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS=<Firebase credential file path here>
   export MY_SQL_DEMO=<MySQL URL here>
   export MY_SQL_DEMO_USER=<MySQL username here>
   export MY_SQL_DEMO_PASSWD=<MySQL password here>
   ```
9. Run the built project with the following command.
   ```bash
   nohup java -jar <WetoxRESTful application you built> &
   ```
10. It also runs a Python server with the following code. Make sure the AI-generated image has the correct path.
    ```python
    import os
    import random

    from flask import Flask, send_file
    from PIL import Image
    from io import BytesIO

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/ai/image/profile')
    def get_image():
        directory_path = <<Path where AI-generated images are stored>>
        all_files = os.listdir(directory_path)
        png_files = [file for file in all_files if file.lower().endswith('.png')]
        selected_file = random.choice(png_files)
        file_path = os.path.join(directory_path, selected_file)
        image = Image.open(file_path)
        image_io = BytesIO()
        image.save(image_io, format='PNG')
        image_io.seek(0)
        return send_file(image_io, mimetype='image/png')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```
